%h1 People Make Things Happen!
%p
  RailsBridge is an
  %em extremely
  non-heirarchical organization. Since we needed to forum a legal corporation to take donations from  companies, though, we do have a board that makes decisions (with lots of input from the community, of course). The three-person RailsBridge board is Sarah Mei and Sarah Allen, co-founders, and Austin Putman, treasurer.
%p Here is just a handful of the people who have made RailsBridge successful!
