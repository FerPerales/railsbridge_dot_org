  %h1 Help RailsBridge Change the World

.col-md-9
  %h3 RailsBridge is run entirely on donations of money, time, and expertise.

  %p
    If your company or organization can help us make tech more welcoming and more diverse,
    we'd love your help. We need workshops sponsors (mostly to cover the cost of food), and also
    program sponsors so that we can help workshops happen in new places that don't yet
    have companies to help sponsor and host!

  %p
    RailsBridge works with #{ link_to "Bridge Foundry", "https://bridgefoundry.org/", class: 'inline-link' }, a 501(c)3 charitable organization, so that we're
    able to accept tax deductible donations.
