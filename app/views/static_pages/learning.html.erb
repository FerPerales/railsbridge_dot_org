<h2>Finding a workshop to attend</h2>
<p>  There are workshops all over the place. Our <%= link_to "Chapters page", about_chapters_path %> can help you find a worskhop in your area. And if there isn't one planned, we can <%= link_to "help you set one up", organizing_path %>!</p>

<h2>Before the workshop</h2>
<h4>Installation Instructions</h4>
<p>These slides walk you through the installation: <a href="http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/installfest" target="_blank">http://installfest.railsbridge.org</a>. Try to do as much of this as you can before you come to the InstallFest so they can focus on working out any kinks you may run into!</p>
<h4>Curriculum Preview</h4>
<p>These slides are a preview of some of the material you&#8217;ll be going through: <a href="http://curriculum.railsbridge.org/curriculum/curriculum" target="_blank">http://curriculum.railsbridge.org</a>.  Depending on your class, you may go through these slides or others, but feel free to look through them to get a general idea of what you&#8217;ll be building in the workshop.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Q: Do I have to attend the Installfest?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes! The Installfest is a crucial part of the weekend, even if you&#8217;ve already gone through the instructions independently. There are a ton of moving parts when setting up a development environment, and the reason that we&#8217;re able to get through the curriculum on Saturday is that every single student has had their dev environment checked and has been awarded a sticker for their successes. There are also enough changing parts that even if you&#8217;ve been to a workshop in the past, you should attend the Installfest to get re-verified, because this stuff changes almost constantly.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I really have to attend the Installfest?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, really. There will be pizza, we promise. And fun people to talk to. And you don&#8217;t have to be there very long if you&#8217;ve already gotten through all the steps. (But if you haven&#8217;t gotten through all the steps ahead of time, please come early in the evening, because an install can take a few hours depending on what hiccups we get to work through.)</p>
<p><strong>Q: How much does childcare cost?</strong></p>
<p>A: Nothing! RailsBridge hires a sitter on the house so that there&#8217;s nothing between you and your computer. Just let the organizer know ahead of time so we can make arrangements; the sitter has historically always been in the office, usually in a lounge/conference room somewhere away from the learning.</p>
