          %p 
            This is the most important thing: pick your next project
            \&mdash;
            a tutorial, a class, or building your own app
            \&mdash;
            and get started right away. Momentum is important.

      %h4 Keep in touch
      %ul
        %li
          %p Reach out to the people you connected with at your workshop. Coding with other people around is really motivating, plus you get to help each other solve trickier stuff.

      %h4 More RailsBridge
      %ul
        %li
          %p Come back to another workshop as a student, TA, or teacher. Teaching is a really great way to learn, too. (You'll be ready to TA sooner than you think, so don't be shy!)
