%h1 Keep on learning! Here are some ways to do it.
%h2 You attended a RailsBridge workshop! That's wonderful! Wondering what to do next?
%p This is the most important thing:
%h3 Pick your next project: a tutorial, a class, or building your own app, and GET STARTED!
%p Also:
%ul
  %li Keep in touch with the people you connected with at your workshop. Coding with other people around is really motivating, plus you get to help each other solve trickier stuff.
  %li Come back to another workshop as a student, TA, or teacher. You will definitely learn more, and teaching is a really great way to learn, too. (For those who are new to this: you'll be prepared to TA sooner than you think, so don't be shy! We need you!)
